# How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, please open an issue with a description of the feature you'd like to add/propose OR comment on a current issue and let me know you'd like to work on it. Please don't just open a pull request with your changes without checking in with me first. This ensures someone else isn't already working on the same task.
