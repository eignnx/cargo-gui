# Setting Up Development Environment

If you want to contribute to the project, you'll want to download the project from the GitHub repository and be able to run that development version rather than the  `cargo gui` version that's on crates.io.

## Clone the Repository

First get the source code from GitHub:

### Linux

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/eignnx/cargo-gui.git
```

### Windows 10

```powershell
> git clone https://github.com/eignnx/cargo-gui.git
```

## Save Working Directory

Save the path to the `cargo-gui/Cargo.toml` file. This is needed to—from a different directory—run the development copy you just downloaded (as opposed to the `cargo gui` command you may have installed from crates.io).

### Linux

```shell
$ cd cargo-gui
$ # Save the manifest file's path
$ CARGO_GUI_DEV=`pwd`/Cargo.toml
```

### Windows 10

```powershell
> cd cargo-gui
> # Save the manifest file's path
> set CARGO_GUI_DEV=%cd%/Cargo.toml
```

## Start the Server

Next, go to the directory of some cargo project and start the `cargo-gui` server:

### Linux

```shell
$ cd path/to/my-cargo-project
$ cargo run --manifest-path $CARGO_GUI_DEV

Server is listening on: http://127.0.0.1:9345
```

### Windows 10

```powershell
> cd path\to\my-cargo-project
> cargo run --manifest-path %CARGO_GUI_DEV%

Server is listening on: http://127.0.0.1:9345
```

## Open the Dashboard

Now open that link in your web browser: [http://localhost:9345/](http://localhost:9345/)
